GETTING STARTED

At this point I am assuming that you have sucessfully installed TimsheetXoops as a module in Xoops 2 (see timesheetXoops_README).
The installation procedure creates a couple of users in the TimesheetXoops user table - guest and admin.
Unless you have a Xoops user called guest then you will probably never use it.

ADMINISTRATION
So, logon to Xoops as admin then select 'timesheetXoops' from the menu.
You will notice that as admin you have the ability to create Clients, Projects, Tasks etc as well as making
changes to some configuration settings. The LDAP stuff is a legacy from the original Timesheet.php application
and isn't used in the Xoops module.

ADDING USERS
Adding new users to TimesheetXoops is managed using the User Maintenance screen within the Module.
You can select existing Xoops users to add to the module and you can remove any users already
selected to have access to the module.

If you wish to enable other users to add, modify, delete Projects,
Clients, Tasks etc then use the 'Preferences' menu option in the Xoops Admin menu and select
the required group levels for each of the menu options.
