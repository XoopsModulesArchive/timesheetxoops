TimesheetXoops 1.2.3

This release has 3 key features added:

   - User maintenance is now fully integrated with the Xoops User table
   
   - The original Timesheet.php user interface now works in the module.
   		
   		
INSTALLING THE UPGRADE
The good news is there are no database changes!

Simply delete your existing ./modules/timesheetxoops directory and unpack the new archive.
Then you must go into Xoops Module Admin and update the module.

If you haven't created any data then you can easily just deinstall the module, delete the directory
and install everything from scratch.
